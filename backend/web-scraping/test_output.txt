At ABC Wildlife, we believe diversity is critical in every scientific field from biology to chemical engineering. While women represent 48% of the American workforce, they make up only 13% of engineering professionals and a mere 7.2% in the field of mechanical engineering. Overall, women are critically underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As a woman-owned corporation operating in a largely male field, we understand the remarkable impact women can have. We want to pave the way for other women pursuing their dreams in the scientific world, which is why ABC Wildlife is introducing a scholarship designed to increase the number of women studying and influencing the future of science, including technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

At ABC Wildlife, we believe diversity is critical in every scientific field from biology to chemical engineering. While women represent 48% of the American workforce, they make up only 13% of engineering professionals and a mere 7.2% in the field of mechanical engineering. Overall, women are critically underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As a woman-owned corporation operating in a largely male field, we understand the remarkable impact women can have. We want to pave the way for other women pursuing their dreams in the scientific world, which is why ABC Wildlife is introducing a scholarship designed to increase the number of women studying and influencing the future of science, including technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

At ABC Wildlife, we believe diversity is critical in every scientific field from biology to chemical engineering. While women represent 48% of the American workforce, they make up only 13% of engineering professionals and a mere 7.2% in the field of mechanical engineering. Overall, women are critically underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As a woman-owned corporation operating in a largely male field, we understand the remarkable impact women can have. We want to pave the way for other women pursuing their dreams in the scientific world, which is why ABC Wildlife is introducing a scholarship designed to increase the number of women studying and influencing the future of science, including technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
